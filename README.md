# Syntax Validator
Simple Semi-C language code validator.

Accepts code filename as argument and checks for syntax errors.
The language grammar is slightly different from the standard C grammar. You can find check the grammar in grammar.txt.
This is just an academical project but I welcome any suggestions or PRs.
